One of many values used by the Tale engine to gauge how well or poorly a
creature fares when they attempt to perform a class of actions.  In Tale,
players are not privy to the numeric value of their stats, so they
must go about finding out the parameters of their character in more
challenging and dangerous ways.

Stats include:

 * ["Thaum"]
 * ["Umph"]

Stats can be altered by:

 * ["Buff"]s
 * ["Nerf"]s
