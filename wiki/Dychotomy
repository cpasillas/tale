The faces of ["Dya"] and their people form six nations in two ["Trychotomy"]s and the following three ["Dychotomy"]s:

 * ["Euia"] against ["Dysia"], both ["Idealist"]
 * ["Occia"] against ["Oria"], both ["Lawful"]
 * ["Borea"] against ["Austra"], both ["Chaotic"]

On the ["HexForce"], the ["Dychotomy"]s face off on three axes so hues of the shards of ["HexForce"] from opposing sides from each ["Dychotomy"]s also are on opposite sides of a color wheel.  One side corresponds to ["Light"] while the other to ["Tint"].  However, members of each ["Dychotomy"] share ["Temperament"] regarding their moral ["Alignment"], chaos for chaos, law for law.
