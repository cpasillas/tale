The itro is a shamanistic humanoid hairball, which grows through two stages of life.
In the first stage, one can tell the age of the itro by the length of its hair; a bald itro is new-born, whereas an itro whose afro envelops it entirely is almost ready to enter the second stage of its life.
The second stage of the itro begins when at last the toes are completely covered by hair.  An itro then proceeds to roll until it finds suitable soil, and implants itself there.  It grows a stalk then beneath the afro until, a short while later, the afro spreads like the cap of a mushroom, and new baby itro are released.
Name subject to change.
