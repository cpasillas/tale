Each face of ["Dya"] has a musical tonic, a ["DyalTone"].  Motion from face to face therefore has a corresponding modulation.

Each ["Trychotomy"]'s group of tonics forms a major triad.  C Major is formed by Dysia, Austra, and Occia while F# Major (a tritone removed from C Major) is formed by Euia, Borea, and Oria.

Each ["Dychotomy"]'s tonics are at an interval of a tritone relative to one another.

This means that when travelling to an adjacent face, the intervals by which the tonic may change, ordered ascending by dissonance, are P5/P4, M3/m6, M2/m7, or m2/M7.  The opposite face is a tritone away, arguably similar in dissonance to the m2/M7, but for these purposes, the least consonant of intervals possible.

When moving to an adjacent face, here are the possible tonic transitions:
||Current Tonic||||||||New Tonic||
||F#|| C# || A# || E || G ||
||C# || F# || A# || E || C ||
||A# || F# || C# || G || C ||
||E || F# || C# || G || C ||
||G || F# || A# || E || C ||
||C || C# || A# || E || G ||
