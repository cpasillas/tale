An insidious cybernetic mushroom beast that dwells in the mushroom forest.

The result of a macabre robotics experiment gone horribly wrong, the first Shroombas were created by Gnome scientists who were obsessed with developing the ideal automated home cleaning device. A grotesque fusion of technological and organic components, Shroombas typically hunt in packs and emit psychotropic spores to immobilize their victims before consumption. Shroombas are biochemically programmed with a profound fixation on cleanliness and have been known to brutally slaughter those who litter in the mushroom forests.
