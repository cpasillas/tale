The underside of Dys, a mountain inside Dya, that upon the transition through the bottom of the pit of Dys, is revealed to be a DysonCube.  Magma and Water flowing through Dys meet in the gravitational center of Dya causing a sustained chemical reaction that lights the interior of the world, producing a could of ["Mana"] byproducts.  From the summit, all of ParaDya is visible: ParaOria, ParaAustra, ParaBorea, ParaOccia, and ParaEuia.
