A three stage ballista for sending monkeys into orbit: monkeys named Albert.  The first balista fires a BallistaBallista, which at apogee fires a ["Ballista"], which at apogee fires ["Albert"] into orbit.  With a loyal ["Monkey"] in space, you can rain feces on a field of battle.  With a loyal InsaneMutantMonkey in orbit, there's no telling where the radioactive feces will fall.
