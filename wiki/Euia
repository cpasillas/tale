The first face of ["Dya"], an idyllic vale inhabited by ["Sprite"]s (literally) in turn ruled by ["PrincessDya"], the pampered-brat-regent who's always getting herself kidnapped by the ["Monster"] of the Week.  This eutopian monarchy is nestled safely among two mountain ranges with 6 peaks.  Ice in the EuianMountains melts and flows into the EuianRiver into ["Occia"].  Euia is home of those with good, pure hearts, innocence, and disturbingly happy-go-lucky cheer.  Euia is also home of the GreenShard of HexForce.
