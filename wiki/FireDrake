The fire drakes (and female ducks) of ["Oria"] are a species of magical metal elementals and alloyals.  They breathe a fire from a resinous, oily substance produced by their MyrrhGland.  Their elder, FrancisDrake, lives in the heart of the vulcan mountains of the East, is a 24^ GoldDrake and sees all with its FrankenSense.  Only the wise can hold discourse with a FrancisDrake and survive, and any person who survives a conversation with FrancisDrake is considered ["Wise"].
