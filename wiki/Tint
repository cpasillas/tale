The ["Trychotomy"] of the ["MagentaShard"], ["YellowShard"], and ["CyanShard"] from ["Dysia"], ["Oria"], and ["Austra"].  The tint trychotomy metaphorically combines to consume white light and represents the ["Free"] ["Alignment"]s in ["Dya"].  The ["Tint"] shards are associated with consumption, absorption, hedonism, carelessness, care-freeness, death, and renewal.  ["Light"] is the opposite of ["Tint"] as there is tension between it's ["Free"] ["Alignment"]s and the opposite ["Nice"] alignments.
