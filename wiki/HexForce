A magical hexagon composed of 6 triangular shards of indestructable matter distributed among the faces of ["Dya"] on which ["Dyo"] wrote the rules from which the world's patterns emerged in indelible, illegible glyphs.  ["Mana"] flows from the ["Light"] shards to the ["Tint"] shards...or was it the other way around?

["Light"] shards:

 * GreenShard from ["Euia"]
 * BlueShard from ["Occia"]
 * RedShard from ["Borea"]

["Tint"] shards:

 * CyanShard from ["Austra"]
 * YellowShard from ["Oria"]
 * MagentaShard from ["Dysia"]
