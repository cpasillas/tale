The ["Trychotomy"] of the ["GreenShard"], ["BlueShard"], and ["RedShard"] from ["Euia"], ["Occia"], and ["Borea"].  The light trychotomy metaphorically combines to produce white light and represents the ["Nice"] ["Alignment"]s and the constructive aspects of life in ["Dya"] including birth, altruism, community, selflessness, guilt, cheer, and peace.  ["Tint"] is the opposite of ["Light"] just as the ["Free"] ["Temperament"] and its ["Alignment"]s are the opposite of ["Nice"].
