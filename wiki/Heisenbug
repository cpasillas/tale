The dread heisenbug only appears when you're not looking for it. You can either know where it is or how fast it's going (assuming mass is constant). When you discover one, it changes the other. The heisenbug prefers dark places and plenty of yummy poop.  The heisenbug is not to be confused with the SchroedingersCat.
