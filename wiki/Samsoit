The Samsoit is a shamanistic humanoid hairball, which grows through two stages of life. In the first stage, one can tell the age of the Samsoit by the length of its hair; a bald Samsoit is new-born, whereas an Samsoit whose afro envelops it entirely is almost ready to enter the second stage of its life. The second stage of the Samsoit begins when at last the toes are completely covered by hair. An Samsoit then proceeds to roll until it finds suitable soil, and implants itself there. It grows a stalk then beneath the afro until, a short while later, the afro spreads like the cap of a mushroom, and new baby Samsoit are released.
The most distinguishing feature of Samsoit Psychology is an extreme aversion to the loss of hair.  Samsoit have been known to faint at the sight of anything resembling scissors, and those who have inflicted such a hurt to a Samsoit are often tracked down by Samsoit who have dedicated themselves to avenging such a wound.
