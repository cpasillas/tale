The southern face of the world, home of the ChaoticEvil ["Penguin"] horde.  The austral face is flooded by the AustralSea and dominated by 3 ice-berg islands.  The penguin horde is anarchic, in keeping with the political philosophy in the writings of MagusAustralis.  Austra covets the CyanShard of HexForce.  The SinisterLighthouse looms on the south pole and is the refuge of the ["Dwarf"]s of the south.
