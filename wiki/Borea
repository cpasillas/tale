The northern face of the world, ruled by well-intentioned fascist elves who practice and enforce a strict dress-code and adore their eminently ["Booz"]ed leader, MagusBorealis.  The "Red Mage of the North" is all but a prisoner in the red, candy-striped BorealTower of the north pole surrounded by sycophantic ["Elf"]s.  Borea is a baren ice-waste hemmed among 4 mountains in its corners and the BorealSea on its southern edge, shared with ["Occia"].  Borea is the home of the RedShard of HexForce.
